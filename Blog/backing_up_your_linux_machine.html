<h1 class="title">Backing up your Linux machine</h1>
<p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">Published Saturday  8 April 2023 at 12:00 BST</p>
</header><p>
<i>I wrote the following advice for members of the Astrophysics Research Group at the University of Surrey. I publish it here, unchanged, in the hope that it might be of use to others too.</i>
</p>

<p>
The University does not provide automated backup of Linux machines, but instead leaves you to worry about this yourself.
I suspect that most Linux users back up their data in a happy-go-lucky way, using GitLab and external storage, performing commits and file transfers only
when they remember.
But with some intermediate-level Bash tinkering you can arrange for full backups to be made automatically to a schedule.
Setting this up should take half an hour or so.
The first backup will take considerably longer but will not need your attention (my home drive is currently 180 Gb in size and took 15 hrs to first backup) while subsequent backups will take only minutes.
</p>

<p>
<b>Badly performed backups can result in the loss of data. Be careful. I will outline the prescription that I use for backing up data, but you must decide for yourself if you wish to adopt it too.</b>
</p>

<p>
Your data is threatened by hardware failure, operating system failure, theft, and attack.
But the greatest threat is likely yourself since (if you are are like me) you are forever breaking code and deleting files.
So you want to make frequent backups that are easily accessed.
In doing so you should really follow the <i><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup">3-2-1 principle</a></i></i>, keeping three copies of your data (the original and two copies), using at least two types of
media, one of which is off site.
Ideally, one of the backup copies should be kept offline, and you should be able to check that both backups are functioning (this is sometimes called the `3-2-1-1-0 principle', the additional digits representing one offine copy, and zero repository errors).
</p>

<p>
The two backup media can be provided by a cloud file system and an external storage device.
The cloud file system is, of course, off site and the external storage device is offline (or at least it is when you unplug it from your machine).
The University allows you 1 TB of storage on Microsoft OneDrive and if you can live with the shame of using a Microsoft product this provides your cloud file system.
However, the University does not provide you with external storage devices, which you must buy yourself.
A 1 TB hard disc drive (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD) costs less than £100, and a 256 Gb thumb drive costs £25.
These devices last forever and you will not regret buying one.
</p>

<p>
To make your backups you can use the programme <a href="https://restic.net/">Restic</a>.
This is fast and easy to use, and consequently takes the pain out of backing up your data.
Importantly, it allows you to check that a backup is error free.
With OneDrive, external storage, and Restic, you can build a backup system that satisfies all of your requirements.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgf44e621" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf44e621">Accessing OneDrive: Rclone</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf44e621">
<p>
You have access to <a href="https://it.surrey.ac.uk/file-storage">OneDrive file storage</a> with your University IT account.
OneDrive is integrated with Windows and various consumer and business applications like Microsoft 365, from which Microsoft expect you to access it.
However, you can use <a href="https://rclone.org/">Rclone</a> to manage a cloud file system from any machine, as if it were local.
To install Rclone and configure it to work with OneDrive follow the <a href="https://itsfoss.com/use-onedrive-linux-rclone/">guide</a> from <i><i>It's FOSS</i></i>.
Ignore Step 6 (we will not need to mount OneDrive on startup).
With OneDrive still mounted, create a backup repository (a OneDrive directory called <code>Backup</code>) using a new terminal, as follows.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ mkdir OneDrive/Backup
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Then unmount OneDrive by returning to the first terminal and stopping Rclone with <code>C-c</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2fc0bd3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2fc0bd3">Backing up to OneDrive with Restic</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2fc0bd3">
<p>
<a href="https://restic.net/">Restic</a> performs full backups of a specified directory but avoids duplication by transmitting only new and modified files to the repository each time a backup is made.
This makes all but the first backup very fast and the repository itself very light.
Assuming that you are using Ubuntu, you can install Restic with APT as follows.
(For other Linux distibutions, see <a href="https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/020_installation.html">here</a>.)
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ sudo apt install restic
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The Restic documentation is available <a href="https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">here</a> and there are three handy tutorials at <a href="https://medium.com/codex/restic-backup-i-simple-and-beautiful-backups-bdbbc178669d">Remo Hoeppli's Medium blog</a>, <a href="https://www.labsrc.com/restic-the-backup-you-should-be-using/">LabSrc</a>, and <a href="https://www.nadazero.ch/posts/incremental-backups-with-restic/">J.L. Falcone's webpage</a>.
(Unfortunately, the last of these calls Restic backups `incremental'.
In fact they are full.)
Let us go through the essentials.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8382ff5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8382ff5">Initializing the backup repository</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8382ff5">
<p>
First you must initialize the backup repository with the following command, which will prompt you to choose and confirm a password.
(I assume that OneDrive is secure and therefore use a trivial password, namely <code>password</code>.)
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ restic -r rclone:onedrive:Backup init
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0d9e765" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0d9e765">Performing the first backup</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0d9e765">
<p>
You are nearly ready to make the first backup.
This will take considerable time, although subsequent backups will be much quicker.
First, however, you should make a dry run, which reduces the risk of data loss.
To do so, run the following, where <code>Path/</code> is the path to the directory you wish to back up (I suggest you back up your home directory, <code>~/</code>), entering your password when prompted.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ restic -r rclone:onedrive:Backup backup Path/ --dry-run
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Before the real thing, though, another word of warning: do not access your files while a backup is being made.
It is not the end of the world if you do, but there is a chance that an open file will be corrupted.
For this reason, it is best to perform the backup overnight, when you are not using your machine.
You will probably want to use the University network for this.
(When I checked, my home upload speed was about 50 times smaller, at 18 kbps, than the University's, at 915 kbps.)
With all these preliminaries out of the way, you can make your first backup by running the previous command without the <code>dry-run</code> flag.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ restic -r rclone:onedrive:Backup backup Path/
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb2bcea5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb2bcea5">Viewing the backup</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb2bcea5">
<p>
Each backup of a directory is called a `snapshot'.
Once your first backup is complete, you should have a single snapshot in your OneDrive repository.
At any time you may use the following command to view a list of all available snapshots.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ restic -r rclone:onedrive:Backup snapshots
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This time you should see just one.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3eb3d28" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3eb3d28">Checking the backup</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3eb3d28">
<p>
You should also check that the repository is error free, as follows.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ restic -r rclone:onedrive:Backup check
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Again, you can issue this command at any time.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf0f790a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf0f790a">Automating the backup</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf0f790a">
<p>
You can schedule Restic to run automatically using the utility <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">Cron</a>.
To do this you create a script that is run by the Cron daemon at specified times.
Suppose you wish to keep daily snapshots for the last seven days, weekly snapshots for the last month, and monthly snapshots for the last year.
You can do this using the Restic command <code>forget</code>.
</p>

<p>
First create the shell script <code>/usr/local/bin/linux_backup.sh</code> containing the following.
(You will need to use <code>sudo</code> to write to this directory.)
</p>

<p>
The results of <code>backup</code>, <code>forget</code> and <code>check</code> are written to the log files <code>.cache/restic/log/${TIMESTAMP}_backup.log</code>, <code>.cache/restic/log/${TIMESTAMP}_forget.log</code>, and <code>.cache/restic/log/${TIMESTAMP}_check.log</code>.
You should inspect these intermittently to make sure that the repository is in good health.
If you have the Mail utility (or equivalent) configured to send email from the command line, you can send an alert to yourself when a backup fails or a repository error is discovered.
Instead of the previous script use the following one, changing the email address as required.

# Back up home directory to specified repositories
backup rclone:onedrive:Backup
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This will again write to file the outputs of the <code>backup</code>, <code>forget</code>, and <code>check</code> commands.
If you are online it will also email you when any of these commands fail.
If you are offline when this script runs, however, it will not be able to email you, and because you are offline your backup will have failed.
</p>

<p>
If you keep your machine on overnight you might schedule the script to be run at, say, 02.01.
To do so, call Crontab from the command line.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ crontab -e
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This will open a Cron file (containing a table of scheduled jobs) in your default text editor.
Append the following line, being sure to leave a carriage return at its end.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">1 2 * * * sh /usr/local/bin/linux_backup.sh
</pre>
</div>
<p>
If you do not leave your machine on overnight, it is probably best to schedule your backups for startup.
Instead, append the following to your Cron file.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">@reboot sh /usr/local/bin/linux_backup.sh
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This will back up your machine when you reboot (i.e. start or restart) it.
</p>

<p>
You still want to avoid writing to files while the backup is being made.
If you do write to file then it is possible that the logs will show the backup to have failed.
However, it will not be the whole backup that has failed, only the backup of the files to which you have written.
</p>

<p>
To use Restic commands without having to manually enter the password for a repository (as we require when using Cron) you may set Restic's environment variable <code>RESTIC_PASSWORD</code>.
To make this available system wide, add the following to the file <code>/etc/environment</code>.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">RESTIC_PASSWORD=password
</pre>
</div>
<p>
(This file should already exist and probably contains the <code>PATH</code> variable.
If it doesn't exist then create it.)
</p>

<p>
Be sure that the scheduled job is being run as expected by checking that a snapshot has been created and by checking the log files.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbb79fe1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgbb79fe1">Recovering the backup</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbb79fe1">
<p>
To recover data from your backup first create the directory to which this data will be restored, <code>/tmp/restored_work</code>.
You can restore entire snapshots or specific files and directories from a single snapshot.
To restore a specific directory or file (with the path <code>Path/</code>) from a specific snapshot, with ID <code>snapshotID</code>, use the following command.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ restic -r rclone:onedrive:Backup restore snapshotID --target /tmp/restored_work --include Path/To/Dir/Or/file
</pre>
</div>
<p>
To restore the same directory or file from the latest snapshot use this.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ restic -r rclone:onedrive:Backup restore latest --target /tmp/restored_work --include Path/To/Dir/Or/file
</pre>
</div>
<p>
To restore a specific snapshot, with ID <code>snapshotID</code>, use this (it will of course take considerable time).
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ restic -r rclone:onedrive:Backup restore snapshotID --target /tmp/restored_work
</pre>
</div>
<p>
And to restore the latest snapshot use this.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ restic -r rclone:onedrive:Backup restore latest --target /tmp/restored_work
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The really neat thing is that the directory <code>/tmp/restored_work</code> need not be on the machine from which your back up has been made.
If this machine is, for example, irreparably damaged, you can simply restore data to a new machine in the same way (of course you will need your repository password).
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org411d435" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org411d435">Backing up to an external storage device with Restic</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org411d435">
<p>
OneDrive is itself backed up, and this might make you think that a second storage medium is redundant.
(For details on recovering data from OneDrive see Microsoft's advice <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/restore-a-previous-version-of-a-file-stored-in-onedrive-159cad6d-d76e-4981-88ef-de6e96c93893%E2%80%89">here</a>.)
But the point is that OneDrive may be unavailable (if, say, your connection to it is broken) and that a third party has control of your account, which might be suspended or closed at any point.
Hence the need for a second backup medium in the form of an external storage device.
</p>

<p>
On your external storage device again create a repository called <code>Backup</code>.
This will be available as <code>Path/To/External/Storage/Device/Backup</code>.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ restic -r Path/To/External/Storage/Device/Backup init
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Then back up to it using the following command.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ restic -r Path/To/External/Storage/Device/Backup backup Path/ --dry-run
</pre>
</div>
<p>
If all is well run the same command without the <code>dry-run</code> flag.
This will again take some considerable time. 
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ restic -r Path/To/External/Storage/Device/Backup backup Path/
</pre>
</div>
<p>
To schedule automatic backups using Cron we need change only the file <code>/usr/local/bin/linux_backup.sh</code>.
Add the following line to it.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">backup Path/To/External/Storage/Device/Backup
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Again, check that the scheduled job runs as expected.

If not then it is wise to check your log files intermittently.
